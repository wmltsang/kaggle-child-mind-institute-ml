Note for Kaggle competition 12/5/24

Final data examine for the main dataset

quick search - is it better to train the model based on test data col instead of train
season related col - get one with less null value, look at Jason notebook


Class separability in SII - will aim to use LDA, KPCA if is not linear  

Model Evaluation -
stratified k-fold cross-validation to est model general performance
use ROC AUC score to check model general performance
 
Gradient boosting finding hyperparameter - grid search for fine tuning the performance of the ML model

Class imbalance
upsampling the minority class in sii
