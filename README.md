# Kaggle Competition - Child Mind Institute: Problematic Internet Use

The high level goal of this competition is to analyze children's physical activity data to detect early indicators of problematic internet and technology use. 

About the data, there are descriptive data such as each individual's BMI, season to participate for tracking the physical activitiy and there is another dataset associated with each individual where they have continuous data to track there physical activity with the watches they wore on them. The goal is to take this data and understand how they correlate to the sii level that we need to predict that is an indicator they have problematic internet use.

## Learning curve and learning from others

This is my first ever machine learning competition which involves a lot of learning. I have partnered myself with Jason, a data science director from Nashville,TN and a software developer Shashi in Nepal with strong quantitative background for this competition. 

Key takeaway with Jason would be his strength to do early exploration on the data, by understanding the data, the way that he structures the approaches to them and provides me advice along the way. He encourages me to have my own model that would help learning. Dont be afraid to change codes and save different version and that way you have your thoughts throughout the codes and would not get lost with different model in the same notebook. Clean codes and documentiong and sectioning out are key to save you time later. I was able to get 0.369 where highest score is 0.482 that tells how challenging this competition was. 

With Shashi, we decided to read a machine learning book that was called Python Machine Learning by
